  abstract = "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in complex pathological
              reactions, where the initial lesion is followed by secondary
              inflammation and edema. Our laboratory and others have reported
              that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have efficacy in
              improving recovery from traumatic brain injury in mice. Treatment
              of mice with a subhypotensive dose of the ARB candesartan results
              in improved functional recovery, and reduced pathology (lesion
              volume, inflammation and gliosis). In order to gain a better
              understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which
              candesartan improves recovery after controlled cortical impact
              injury (CCI), we performed transcriptomic profiling on brain
              regions after injury and drug treatment. We examined RNA
              expression in the ipsilateral hippocampus, thalamus and
              hypothalamus at 3 or 29 days post injury (dpi) treated with
              either candesartan (0.1 mg/kg) or vehicle. RNA was isolated and
              analyzed by bulk mRNA-seq. Gene expression in injured and/or
              candesartan treated brain region was compared to that in sham
              vehicle treated mice in the same brain region to identify genes
              that were differentially expressed (DEGs) between groups. The
              most DEGs were expressed in the hippocampus at 3 dpi, and the
              number of DEGs reduced with distance and time from the lesion.
              Among pathways that were differentially expressed at 3 dpi after
              CCI, candesartan treatment altered genes involved in
              angiogenesis, interferon signaling, extracellular matrix
              regulation including integrins and chromosome maintenance and DNA
              replication. At 29 dpi, candesartan treatment reduced the
              expression of genes involved in the inflammatory response. Some
              changes in gene expression were confirmed in a separate cohort of
              animals by qPCR. Fewer DEGs were found in the thalamus, and only
              one in the hypothalamus at 3 dpi. Additionally, in the hippocampi
              of sham injured mice, 3 days of candesartan treatment led to the
              differential expression of 384 genes showing that candesartan in
              the absence of injury had a powerful impact on gene expression
              specifically in the hippocampus. Our results suggest that
              candesartan has broad actions in the brain after injury and
              affects different processes at acute and chronic times after
              injury. These data should assist in elucidating the beneficial
              effect of candesartan on recovery from TBI.",

  abstract = "Summary Detailed molecular profiling of Oryza sativa (rice) was
              carried out to uncover the features that are essential for
              germination and early seedling growth under anoxic conditions.
              Temporal analysis of the transcriptome and methylome from
              germination to young seedlings under aerobic and anaerobic
              conditions revealed 82\% similarity in the transcriptome and no
              differences in the epigenome up to 24 h. Following germination,
              significant changes in the transcriptome and DNA methylation were
              observed between 4-day aerobically and anaerobically grown
              coleoptiles. A link between the epigenomic state and cell
              division versus cell elongation is suggested, as no differences
              in DNA methylation were observed between 24-h aerobically and
              anaerobically germinating embryos, when there is little cell
              division. After that, epigenetic changes appear to correlate with
              differences between cell elongation (anaerobic conditions) versus
              cell division (aerobic conditions) in the coleoptiles.
              Re-oxygenation of 3-day anaerobically grown seedlings resulted in
              rapid transcriptomic changes in DNA methylation in these
              coleoptiles. Unlike the transcriptome, changes in DNA methylation
              upon re-oxygenation did not reflect those seen in aerobic
              coleoptiles, but instead, reverted to a pattern similar to dry
              seeds. Reversion to the ?dry seed? state of DNA methylation upon
              re-oxygenation may act to ?reset the clock? for the rapid
              molecular changes and cell division that result upon
              re-oxygenation.",

  abstract = "limma is an R/Bioconductor software package that provides an
              integrated solution for analysing data from gene expression
              experiments. It contains rich features for handling complex
              experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome
              the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma
              has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential
              expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data.
              The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading,
              normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities
              of limma have been significantly expanded in two important
              directions. First, the package can now perform both differential
              expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing
              (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously
              restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as
              well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and
              microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package
              is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression
              analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in
              terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order
              expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for
              biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This
              article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package,
              summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on
              recent enhancements and features that have not been previously

              lack the modularity associated with packages in programming
              languages, such as R. Here I present gganatogram, an R package
              used to plot modular species anatograms based on a combination of
              the graphical grammar of ggplot2 and the publicly available
              anatograms from the Expression Atlas. This combination allows for
              quick and easy, modular, and reproducible generation of
              anatograms. Using only one command and a data frame with tissue
              name, group, colour, and value, this tool enables the user to
              visualise specific human and mouse tissues with desired colours,
              grouped by a variable, or displaying a desired value, such as
              gene-expression, pharmacokinetics, or bacterial load across
              selected tissues. gganatogram consists of 5 highly annotated
              organisms, male/female human/mouse, and a cell anatogram. It
              further consists of 24 other less annotated organisms from the
              animal and plant kingdom. I hope that this tool will be useful by
              the wider community in biological sciences. Community members are
              welcome to submit additional anatograms, which can be
              incorporated into the package. A stable version gganatogram has
              been deposited to neuroconductor, and a development version can
              be found on github/jespermaag/gganatogram. An interactive shiny

              other high-throughput projects for hypothesis generation has
              become a vital aspect of post-genomic research. For the
              non-bioinformatics specialist, however, many of the currently
              available tools provide overwhelming amounts of data that are
              presented in a non-intuitive way. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:
              In order to facilitate the interpretation and analysis of
              microarray data and data from other large-scale data sets, we
              have developed a tool, which we have dubbed the electronic
              Fluorescent Pictograph - or eFP - Browser, available at
              http://www.bar.utoronto.ca/, for exploring microarray and other
              data for hypothesis generation. This eFP Browser engine paints
              data from large-scale data sets onto pictographic representations
              of the experimental samples used to generate the data sets. We
              give examples of using the tool to present Arabidopsis gene

               computing environment. This approach assumes that an original
               image can be transformed into a PostScript format (ie, the
               opriginal image is in a standard vector graphics format such as
               PostScript, PDF, or SVG). The grImport package consists of three

  title    = "{WGCNA}: an {R} package for weighted correlation network analysis",
  author   = "Langfelder, Peter and Horvath, Steve",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Correlation networks are increasingly being used in
              bioinformatics applications. For example, weighted gene
              co-expression network analysis is a systems biology method for
              describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray
              samples. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) can be
              used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes,
              for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an
              intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to
              external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and
              for calculating module membership measures. Correlation networks
              facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used
              to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These
              methods have been successfully applied in various biological
              contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and
              analysis of brain imaging data. While parts of the correlation
              network methodology have been described in separate publications,
              there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and
              consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial.
              RESULTS: The WGCNA R software package is a comprehensive
              collection of R functions for performing various aspects of
              weighted correlation network analysis. The package includes
              functions for network construction, module detection, gene
              selection, calculations of topological properties, data
              simulation, visualization, and interfacing with external
              software. Along with the R package we also present R software
              tutorials. While the methods development was motivated by gene
              expression data, the underlying data mining approach can be
              applied to a variety of different settings. CONCLUSION: The WGCNA
              package provides R functions for weighted correlation network
              analysis, e.g. co-expression network analysis of gene expression
              data. The R package along with its source code and additional
              material are freely available at
              http://www.genetics.ucla.edu/labs/horvath/CoexpressionNetwork/Rpackages/WGCNA.",
